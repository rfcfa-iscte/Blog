The tool was designed as a dashboard interface, offering users a clear overview of their academic journey and performance. It was tailored to meet the specific requirements and guidelines set forth by the university, ensuring alignment with institutional standards and information.\n\nProject: For this project, a frontend was developed using Java, while the backend was built with Spring Boot. The data used for analysis and visualization was extracted from Moodle, the university's chosen learning management system. This project marked my initial foray into web development, particularly with React, as I transitioned from primarily theoretical coursework to hands-on application. Notably, it provided valuable experience in working with modern web technologies and frameworks. One key aspect of the project was the implementation of a unified login system, seamlessly integrating with the university's existing authentication infrastructure. Students could access the platform using their university credentials, ensuring a streamlined and familiar user experience consistent with other university systems, such as Moodle and the university's official website.",

    text: "Description: The project involved the creation of a personal website using React, serving as both a professional portfolio and a platform for sharing personal interests and hobbies. The website provided visitors with information about me (the developer), including professional background, skills, and projects, as well as insights into personal hobbies and interests, categorized as 'blogs.' These blogs covered various topics such as gaming, TV shows, movies, and adventures, offering visitors a glimpse into the developer's personal life.\n\nProject: The website was built using React, leveraging its component-based architecture and reusable UI elements to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. One of the key features of the project was its data-driven approach, with information extracted from JSON files. This allowed for easier maintenance and updating of content, as new projects or blog posts could be added simply by modifying the JSON files without the need to modify the codebase. While the initial implementation relied on static data, future plans included adding features to enable content management directly within the website interface. This would provide greater flexibility and control over the content, allowing the developer to easily update and manage information without diving into the codebase. Overall, the project served as both a showcase of technical skills and a creative outlet for sharing personal interests, with the potential for further expansion and refinement in the future.",
